    Chapter 4.7 Exercises
    1. Take several pictures of red, blue, and green items with your phone or other digital camera
    (or download some from the internet, if a camera isnâ€™t available).
    a) Load each image, and convert it to a tensor.
    b) For each image tensor, use the .mean() method to get a sense of how bright the image is.
    C) Take the mean of each channel of your images. Can you identify the red, green, and blue items
    from only the channel averages? Select a relatively large file containing
